1. What is your corpus, why did you choose it, and what do you think is interesting about it?
  - My corpus consists of 86 tracks by the following French and Dutch rap artists and singers: Alonzo, Jul (French) Lijpe and Boef (Dutch). So the corpus consists of both French and Dutch hip-hop music (raps). 
  - I deliberately chose this corpus because I often like listening to French and Dutch rappers myself. 
  - In terms of style and approach, French and Dutch rap are different, but both are characterized by their ability to engage with the issues and experiences of their respective communities, and both have made significant contributions to the development of hip-hop as a global cultural form. It is therefore worth researching rap music of both languages where we will look at the differences and similarities between the two.
