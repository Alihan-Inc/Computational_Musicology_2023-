1. What is your corpus, why did you choose it, and what do you think is interesting about it?
  - My corpus (https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7KtmJXjsDmw8WEdtyL28L3?si=c2b30d69d504472a) consists of 86 tracks by the following French and Dutch rap artists and singers: Alonzo, Jul (French) Lijpe and Boef (Dutch). So the corpus consists of both French and Dutch hip-hop music (raps). 
  - I deliberately chose this corpus because I often like listening to French and Dutch rappers myself. 
  - In terms of style and approach, French and Dutch rap are different, but both are characterized by their ability to engage with the issues and experiences of their respective communities, and both have made significant contributions to the development of hip-hop as a global cultural form. It is therefore worth researching rap music of both languages where we will look at the differences and similarities between the two. 

2. What are the natural groups or comparison points in your corpus (e.g., albums, artists, genres, people)? What do you expect to be different among these groups, what do you expect to be the same, and what are you unsure about? 
  - The natural groups are French rappers (Alonzo & Jul) and Dutch rappers (Lijpe & Boef). 
  - French rap is more characterized by its strong tradition of chanson (which is a style of song that emphasizes vocal performance and poetic lyrics) and French rappers often incorporate African and Carribean music into their work, while Dutch rappers incorporate elements of gabber and house into their work.
  - Both groups produce rap which means that they both use a very fast and energetic flow as well as techniques such as Onomatopoeaia (sue of words that imitate sounds, such as "boom" or "snap"). 
  - However, I am curious to see what the analyses will show. Each rapper obviously has his own way of rapping and, of course, does not always use the same technique. It is therefore important to generalise as much as possible when comparing raps in two languages. Moreover, I tried to keep the rappers as representative as possible. 
  
  3. How representative are the tracks in your corpus for the groups you want to compare? If your corpus is genre-based, how well do you think it covers the genre you are interested in, and what do you think are the most important gaps? 
  - The chosen rappers produce raps in French and Dutch. So to make a comparison or look at differences between Dutch and French raps, I felt it was enough to choose two Dutch and two French artists. 
  - The corpus consist of raps and so it belongs to "Hip hop music" or "rap music". I think the tracks will cover the genre well since they are all raps. 
  - The only gap maybe is that tracks by rapper Alonzo are gangsta rap in addition to hip-hop. Furthermore, Jul also makes hip-house music and tracks by Boef and Lijpe belong to nederhop and street rap. ultimately, they do fall under the umbrella genre "Hip hop".
  
  4. Identify several tracks in your corpus that are either extremely typical or atypical.
   - Typical: Ciao La France (Alonzo), Namek (Jul) and Hoofdpijn (Lijpe)
